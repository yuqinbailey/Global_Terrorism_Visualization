# Global Terrorism during 1970-2017
## Overview
Terrorism indeed overshadows every aspect of economic, social, cultural and political life. While it brings instability and disrupts peace and coexistence environments, it directly endangers the lives of people and brings every type of violence in the society. To appeal for wider attention on such heinous action and contempt for life, we are going to propose a visualization system, which will address different aspects of the danger of terrorism worldwide.

## Data Set: Global Terrorism Database
START. (2018, September). Global Terrorism Database, Version 3. Retrieved November 27, 2020 from https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/r-vs-python-the-kitchen-gadget-test.

We find our database “Global Terrorism” from Kaggle. It includes a set of approximately 180,000 terrorist attacks recorded from 1970 to 2017. Each record describes location, tactic, perpetrator, target, and outcome of the attack. We will visualize 5 attributes that describe the information about these terrorist attacks: year, country, city, attack type and number of people killed. We will also derive a new variable which is the total number of terrorist attacks each country had per year.
